            <h3>Pizza</h3>
            <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually

round,

flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients

(such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high

temperature,

traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is

known

as a pizzaiolo.</p>
